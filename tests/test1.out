# Note the output, it says that there was a message with a given message ID and
# requested Queue DI. This message was sent from fax@example.hr and it wad
# delivered directly to 'nsurname@example.hr'.
#
# The None value of the pair is used when there was some kind of a forwarding.
# For example, when the mail was sent to a distribution list than this second
# argument will be address of the distribution list, while the first address
# will be member's address.
#
# Also, when alias is used, then the second argument is alias.
#
# Finally, if the user has forwardig setup, than the None part will be the
# original user, while the first will be the user that actually got the
# message.
